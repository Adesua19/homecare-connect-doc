# HomeCare Connect

**Connecting Busy Families with Trusted Household Help**

---

## What Is This Project?

HomeCare Connect is a mobile app that helps busy people find reliable household workers for cleaning, cooking, laundry, and errands. Think of it like Uber, but for household chores.

### The Problem

A pregnant mother told me: *"I haven't been able to get anyone to help me do these chores."*

Many busy people face this problem:
- Parents juggling work and childcare
- Professionals with no time for housework
- Students focusing on their studies
- Elderly people who need help at home

At the same time, many domestic workers struggle to find steady jobs and build their reputation.

### The Solution

HomeCare Connect brings these two groups together safely and easily through a mobile app.
